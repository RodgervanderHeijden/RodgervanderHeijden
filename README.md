### :wave: Hi :wave:

I'm Rodger, a Dutch data scientist! My passions include dealing with data, dashboarding and telling stories. 

I like to connect: connecting people for enriching experiences; connecting datasets to paint a more complete picture; but most of all connecting insights to people, allowing them to understand the message and to take action. An analysis which does not result in action or new knowledge is a pointless one. 

I am looking for a new (full-time) challenge. Do you think you have an interesting opportunity? I would love to discuss it!
