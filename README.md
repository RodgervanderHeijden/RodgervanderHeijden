### :wave: Hi :wave:

I'm Rodger, a Dutch data scientist living in Vienna! My passions include dealing with data, dashboarding and telling stories. 

I like to connect: connecting people for enriching experiences; connecting datasets to paint a more complete picture; but most of all connecting insights to people, allowing them to understand the message and to take action. An analysis which does not result in action or new knowledge is a pointless one. 

If you want to talk about how I use data to learn new languages, to find an apartment, to keep in shape or how predicting the future, you're welcome to reach out!
