### :wave: Hi :wave:

I'm Rodger, currently close to finishing my Master's degree in Data Science & Entrepreneurship at the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science ([JADS](www.jads.nl)). My passions include dealing with data, dashboarding and telling stories. 

During my Bachelor's degree I studied research methodologies in social sciences and common human biases. This background allows me to identify and combat issues of data quality and interpretation. 

I like to connect: connecting people for enriching experiences; connecting datasets to paint a more complete picture; but most of all connecting insights to people, allowing them to understand the message and to take action. An analysis which does not result in action or new knowledge is a pointless one.
