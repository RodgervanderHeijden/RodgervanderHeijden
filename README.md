### :wave: Hi :wave:

I'm Rodger, a Dutch full-stack data scientist based in Vienna! 
My passions include dealing with data, dashboarding and telling stories. 
I have used data to learn new languages, to find a place to live, to get back in shape and to solve crimes. 

I like to connect: connecting people for enriching experiences; connecting datasets to paint a more complete picture; but most of all connecting insights to people, allowing them to understand the message and to take action. An analysis which does not result in action or new knowledge is a pointless one. 

At the moment I am looking for a new (full-time) challenge in the world of data. 
Do you think you have an interesting opportunity? 
I would love to discuss it!
